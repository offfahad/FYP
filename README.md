# Sketch2Real: A Deep Learning-Powered Image Translation Application

## Introduction

Sketch2Real is a pioneering image translation application I developed as my final year project for a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science degree. The project was conceived and implemented by a single developer, demonstrating comprehensive skills in machine learning, mobile application development, and backend integration.

## Project Overview

Sketch2Real leverages state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, specifically Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and the Pix2Pix algorithm, to translate hand-drawn human face sketches into realistic images. The application targets both mobile and web platforms, offering users an intuitive and interactive interface for creating lifelike portraits from rough sketches.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Deep Learning Model:** The heart of Sketch2Real is a meticulously crafted deep learning model trained on a custom dataset comprising approximately 5000 samples of human face sketches and their corresponding real images. The model has undergone extensive training for over 10,000 epochs, ensuring exceptional accuracy and realism in image translation.

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Built using the Flutter framework, Sketch2Real seamlessly caters to both mobile and web users, providing a consistent user experience across different devices and platforms.

- **Backend Infrastructure:** The project incorporates a robust RESTful API developed with Flask, enabling seamless communication between the application frontend and the deep learning model. This backend infrastructure ensures efficient handling of user requests and data transmission during the image translation process.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Sketch2Real boasts an intuitive and visually appealing user interface, allowing users to effortlessly draw sketches, upload images, and interact with the application's various features. The interface supports real-time sketch editing, enabling users to refine their creations on the fly.

- **Authentication and Security:** Firebase authentication is integrated into Sketch2Real, ensuring secure user login and data privacy. User authentication mechanisms provide a seamless and secure experience for accessing the application's features and functionalities.

- **State Management and Performance Optimization:** The application leverages the GetX library for efficient state management, optimizing performance and resource utilization. This approach ensures smooth and responsive user interactions, even when handling complex image processing tasks.
